# How to Notify a Client of Appointment Approval 

Any potential client looking to use Student Legal Services has to start by filling out an intake form on the Student Legal Service’s website. Leslie Charters, the primary attorney, reviews the incident report and determines which of the three letter templates the client will receive:

| Letter Template      | Definition | Action |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Conflict      | The client’s issue presents a conflict of interest for SLS.       | Can NOT make an appointment. | 
| Non-service   | The issue is beyond the scope of services offered at SLS.        | Can NOT make an appointment. |
| Appointment | The client’s issue falls within the range of services offered at SLS. | Can make an appointment. | 

This letter will notify the client if they can continue with Student Legal Services, or not. In order to send this letter, you must first create a case file for the client in Maxient.
